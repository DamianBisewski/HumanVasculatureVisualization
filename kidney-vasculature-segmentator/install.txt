The application detects automatically whether there is CUDA installed on the computer.
If CUDA is detected, then the application will run using CUDA. Otherwise it will run using CPU, 
which will result in the application running slower.
Both Linux and Windows platforms are supported. 
The application works for Python 3.10 and 3.11.
If the computer does not have the NVIDIA GPU (device = CPU), the following commands should be executed:

pip install torch==2.1.2+cpu torchvision==0.16.2+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install openmim
mim install mmcv==2.1.0 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cpu/torch2.1/index.html
mim install mmdet
mim install mmpretrain
pip install ensemble-boxes
pip install sahi

For a computer with NVIDIA GPU (device = CUDA), the following commands should be executed:

First install torch & torchvision: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
pip install openmim
mim install mmcv==2.1.0
mim install mmdet
mim install mmpretrain
pip install ensemble-boxes
pip install sahi
